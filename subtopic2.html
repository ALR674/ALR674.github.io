                        Coffee plants originate from the ancient coffee forests of the Ethiopian plateau. In Ethiopia, there is a story, a legend, of a goat herder who discovered the wonders of coffee. His name was Kaldi. 
                        <br> <br>
                        While looking ater the goats he herdered, Kaldi noticed one night that his goats were too restless and enrgetic that they refused to sleep. He traced his memory and discovered that this behaviour only started after the goats ate the fruit of a certain tree: a coffee tree. 
                        <br> <br>
                        A curious discovery, Kaldi reported what he had found to the abbot of the local monstery. The abbot then proceeded to make a drink with the fruit mentioned, and discovered that the drink helped him stay alaert through the long hours of evening prayer. 
                        <br> <br>
                        What a useful find! The abbot told the other monks at the monastery about this energy-inducing fruit, and thus begane the spread of the knowledge of coffee cherries.
                        <br> <br>
                        Word moved east, and soon this unknown "coffee" reached the Arabian peninsula, and would soon extend its reaches across the rest of the world.

                        After learning about coffee from Ethiopia, the Arabian Peninsula started cultivating and trading coffee. In the 15th century, the Yemeni district of Arabia was growing coffee. By the 16th century, coffee's name had spread to Persia, Egypt, Syria and Turkey.
                        <br> <br>
                        Coffee became not only a household drink, but also one enjoyed in <abbr title="public coffee houses">qahveh khaneh</abbr> that started appearing in cities across the Near East. <abbr title="Coffee houses">Qahveh khaneh</abbr> became extremely popular for their drinks, as well as a new found status as a place for all kinds of social activity. Patrons were drinking coffee, engaging in conversation, listening to music, watching performers, playing chess and much more. <abbr title="Coffee houses">Qahveh khaneh</abbr> were fast to become the center of informational exchange, often referred to as "Schools of the Wise".
                        <br> <br>
                        As thousands of pilgrims visited the holy city of Mecca year after year, <abbr title="coffee houses">qahveh khaneh</abbr> and the coffee drink they offered, known back then as the "wine of Araby" started to spread to the rest of the world.

                        Those who travelled to the Near East brought back tales of these never before seen coffee houses and the strange dark beverage they offered. By the 17th century, Europe had joined the coffee craze and the drink was quick to spread across the continent.
                        <br> <br>
                        At first, the drink was met with suspicion and fear. Some called it the "bitter invention of Satan", condamning the drink as something corrupt and impure. It started great controversy to such a degree that Pope Clement VIII received a request to intervene. Unable to refuse, the pop decided to taste the drink for himself before proclaiming his stance. He ended up finding the drink so satisfying that he gave it <abbr title="a dogma of the Catholic Church (the pope is preserved from the possibility of error on doctrine)">papal approval</abbr>.
                        <br> <br>
                        Coffee may have faced a lot of controversy, however, coffee houses were fast front-runners in the world of society activity and communication in the major cities of England, Austria, France, Germany and Holland. In England, places started to pop up where people gathered to engage in stimulating conversations while drinking a cup of coffee bought for a single penny. These places where known as "penny universities".
                        <br> <br>
                        Coffee started to replace beer and wine as the common breakfast drink. Many who replaced alcohol with coffee in their lives started to feel more alrt and energised during the day, improving the quality of their work.
                        <br> <br>
                        By the mid-17th century, London had over 300 coffee houses frequented by merchants, shippers, brokers, artists and more. Many made coffee their business, forming specialised coffee houses.

                        Coffee made its way to <abbr title="present day New York">New Amsterdam</abbr> by the mid-17th century, brought over by the British.
                        <br> <br>
                        Coffee grew in popularity, but remained in tea's shadow until 1773 where the Boston Tea Party occured and changed America's preferred drink from tea to coffee.

                        As knowledge of coffee spread, so too did the demand for the beverage. Coffee was becoming a lucrative business, and countries wanted to get in on the coffee growing monopoly Arabia had.
                        <br> <br>
                        In late-17th century, the Dutch finally managed to get their hands on coffee plant seedlings and attmpted to grow them in India. However, that plan failed. They then tried to grow coffee trees in Batavia, on the island of <abbr title="present day Indonesia">Java</abbr>, and were successful. The plants thrived and soon, the Dutch were able to enter the coffee bean market, their trade growing and productive. They expanded the cultivation of coffee trees to the islands of Sumatra and Celebes. Arabia was no longer the sole provider of coffee beans.

                        In 1714, King Louis XIV of France was gifted with a young coffee plant from the Mayor of Amsterdam. King Louis XIV had the plant planted in the Royal Botanical Gariden in Paris.
                        <br> <br>
                        In 1723, a young naval officer, Gabriel de Clieu, was entrusted to bring a seedling from the plant King Louis XIV had to Martinique. He braved the harsh weather, attempted robbers and pirate attacks to bring the seeling to the Martinique, where it thrived and spread over 18 million coffee trees on the island of Martinique across the span of 50 years. The seedling became the parent of all coffee trees throughout the Caribbean, South and Central America.
                        <br> <br>
                        Francisco de Mello Palheta was sent by the emperor of Brazil to French Guiana to obtain coffee seedlings to bring back to Brazil. At first, the French refused to share their bounty. But the French Governour's wife was charmed by the handsome Brazilian and hide several coffee seeds inside a large bouquet of flowers she gifted him before he left. The number of seeds were enough to start up the gamed Brazilian coffee's billion-dollar industry.
                        <br> <br>
                        Traders, travelers, missionaries and colonists spread coffee seeds to new lands. Coffee trees were planted worldwide and plnatations established in many areas, from forests to mountain highlands. Some flourished, some perished. New nations were formed upon coffee economies. Fortune came and went. By the 18th century, coffee had become one of the world's most profitable and cought after commodity in the world.
