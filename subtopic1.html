                <p class="expandable"> 
                    A coffee plant is actually a fruit tree. Which means, coffee beans are not beans, but in fact the seeds of the coffee cherry! 
                    <br> <br>
                    Like many fruits, coffee cherries start off green before they rippen into a red colour. Coffee cherries are made out of skin, flesh and seed (the coffee bean). Most of the coffee cherry is seed and bean, leaving vry little flesh (or pulp), which is why it is not a popular fruit despite being sweet and fresh.
                    <br> <br>
                    When the coffee cherry gets processed for use of making coffee, its skin and flesh are removed before the coffee bean is washed, roasted and brewed.

                <p class="expandable"> 
                    Having originated in sub-Saharan Africa, Robusta beans are the second most popular coffee beans across the world. Now, they are primarily grown in Africa and Indonesia.
                    <br> <br>
                    Robusta beans are not only pleasant in flavour, being used in coffee blends after, particularly in Vietnam, but they are also high affordable.
                    <br> <br>
                    Robusta beans have a strong smell, and an almost burnt taste that makes it harsher and more bitter than coffee mad from other coffee beans. Though its bitter taste comes off as unpleasant to some, many still enjoy its strong flavour, making it quite  sought after.

                <p class="expandable"> 
                    Excelsa beans are classified as variants of Liberica beans. Like Liberica beans, Excelsa beans grow almost entirely in Southeast Asia. However, Excelsa beans grow at medium altitudes instead of low altitudes.
                    <br> <br>
                    Excelsa beans have a unique flavour: light, tart and fruity. Their aroma and caffeine levels are also lesser than most coffee beans, while still manaing to provide an usual depth of flavour. They are sometimes added into blends for the complexity they add to the flavour.
                    <br> <br>
                    Like Liberica beans, Excelsa beans are most common in Asian markets, and hard to find elsewhere except in speciality roasters.

                <p class="expandable"> 
                    As their name suggests, Liberica beans come from Liberia, which is central and western Africa. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Coffee made from Liberica beans have a strong, appetising floral scent and a bold, smoking flavour. It has an unusual taste, with many who love it and many who do not care for it. It is often mixed with other coffee beans to add body and complexity to the brew.
                    <br> <br>
                    Liberica bean trees are hardyplants, able to tolerate hot and humid climates. It is typically grown at low altitudes, produced mainly in Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines. As such, they are most common in Southeast Asian markets, and quite rare in other markets.

                    <h3> Arabica Beans </h3>
                </div>
                <p class="expandable"> 
                    Used by roughly 60% of the world to brew coffee, Arabica beans are the most common type of coffee bean. They are widely available in stores, and come in many different flavours as their origin of growth changes their taste.
                    <br> <br>
                    Originating from Ethiopia's highlands, Arabic beans got their name from their high popularity in Arabia (present-day Yemen) during the 7th-century. They are said to possibly be the first coffee beans ever consumed.
                    <br> <br>
                    Despite being so common, the price of Arabica beans are higher than most. This is due to how hard it is to grow Arabica beans. Though they grow in about 50 countries around the world, they require shade, water and a high altitude to grow properly. Such conditions are not so easy to secure. Their plants are also weaker to plant diseases, adding to the difficulty of growing them.
